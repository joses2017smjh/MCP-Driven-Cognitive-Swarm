"""MCP Server 2 — News, Injuries & Sentiment.

Wraps src/news. Hardening (indirect prompt injection / tool poisoning):
- article text is UNTRUSTED. It is sanitized (HTML, control, zero-width and
  bidi characters stripped) and reduced to schema-validated fields — enums,
  floats, canonical player names from OUR squad list — before anything is
  returned. Raw scraped text never appears in a tool result, so it can never
  reach the orchestrator's context;
- the only free-ish text returned is the bounded `evidence` audit snippet,
  which is sanitized, ≤160 chars, and clearly labeled for human audit only.

The demo news feed below is deterministic; a real NewsProvider (RSS/NewsAPI)
plugs in behind `fetch_news`/`fetch_structured` without touching tool code.
