"""Compose the full per-match prediction JSON from the artifact bundle.

Authority rules (internal consistency):
- the calibrated + conformal GBM head owns the 1X2 probabilities;
- the Dixon–Coles grid (on the GBM's xG) owns everything scoreline-derived:
  exact scores, over/under, BTTS, knockout advancement, and P(0,0);
- the timing model distributes the grid's goals over time and states but
  never contradicts its marginals (see src/models/sequence.py);
- player props allocate the same team xG — no market gets its own private
  estimate of team strength.
