"""Knockout-bracket projection engine.

Given a pool of teams with recent form, this seeds a single-elimination
bracket by model-derived strength and simulates it round by round. Every tie
is predicted with the same machinery the rest of the system uses — team xG
from a gradient-boosted model, a Dixon-Coles grid for scorelines and
extra-time/penalty advancement, and the goal-timing model for when goals land
— so a bracket is internally consistent with single-match predictions.

Player-level scorers/assists are allocated at the **role level** (striker,
wingers, etc.) from the team's expected goals via the same Poisson allocation
used elsewhere. Naming real individuals requires a women's player-event
provider (e.g. StatsBomb open data, which covers several women's
competitions) — a documented upgrade, not fabricated here.

Every match carries an ``evidence`` block (both teams' form inputs, strength
ranks, the xG the grid was built from, rho) so a user can drill into exactly
what drove each decision.
