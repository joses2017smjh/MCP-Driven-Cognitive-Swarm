"""Sequential model: goal ordering and timing as an inhomogeneous Poisson
process with a learned time profile and score-state effects.

Architecture choice (HMM family, not LSTM)
------------------------------------------
The spec allows LSTM/Transformer or a Markov-family model. We use a
piecewise-constant-intensity Poisson process — the continuous-time cousin of
an HMM whose hidden state is the current scoreline — because:

1. *Reconciliation is exact.* Team i's intensity is
   λ_i(t) = mu_i · m(band(t)) with Σ_b m_b · width_b = 90, so the process
   integrates to exactly the Dixon–Coles mean mu_i. Marginal goal counts
   therefore agree with the score grid by construction, not by post-hoc
   patching. A neural sequence model would need explicit re-projection onto
   the grid's marginals every call.
2. *Data volume.* Public event data covers thousands, not millions, of
   matches; a 6-parameter time profile + 2 state multipliers is the right
   capacity, and it trains deterministically in milliseconds.
3. The training loop below (`fit`) is maximum likelihood via band counts —
   swap-in of a neural intensity model later only has to implement the same
   two methods (`fit`, `intensity_multiplier`).

Remaining discrepancy and how it is resolved
--------------------------------------------
Dixon–Coles' τ makes low scores slightly dependent, while a two-stream
Poisson process is independent, so P(no goals) differs by O(rho·mu²).
``first_scorer`` therefore takes the grid's P(0,0) as ground truth and
scales the home-first/away-first split (whose *ratio* comes from the timing
model) to fill exactly 1 − P(0,0). Grid quantities always win; the sequence
model only ever distributes what the grid says exists.
