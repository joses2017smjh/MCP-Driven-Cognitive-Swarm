"""Answer synthesis: evidence-grounded, uncertainty-forward.

The default renderer is deterministic — every number in the answer is read
straight from the state's evidence/prediction, so it cannot fabricate a stat
by construction. When an LLM synthesizer is wired in (strong-model tier of
the FrugalGPT cascade), it drafts from the same state under a
schema-validated output contract with bounded retry; the deterministic
renderer remains the fallback on validation failure, and its output is what
the golden-set judge treats as the grounding reference.

House rules encoded here:
- lead with the calibrated probabilities AND the conformal set — if the set
  is {home, draw}, say plainly the model cannot separate them;
- disclose every degraded evidence source;
- staking suggestions appear only after explicit human approval.
