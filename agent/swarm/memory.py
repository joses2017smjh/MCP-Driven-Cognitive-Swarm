"""Knowledge / Memory agent.

Two roles from the spec, at the fidelity this project honestly supports:

- **Context alignment (recall)** before planning: pull the deployed system's
  rolling calibration and any stored insights for this fixture, so the run
  starts informed by past outcomes and prior critiques.
- **Memory commit (write)** after synthesis: persist a structured insight —
  including any Critic corrections — for future runs.

This is a lightweight, file-backed insight store layered on the existing
PredictionMemory. It is a deliberate simplification of the spec's "Semantic
Memory Graph (Knowledge Graph + Vector hybrid)"; the interface (recall /
commit keyed by concept) is the part that would carry over to a real KG+vector
backend, which is the documented next step.
